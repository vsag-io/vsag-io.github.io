# Search Request & Filters

This page covers the types that describe *how* to search: the unified
[`SearchRequest`](#searchrequest), the filtering primitives [`Filter`](#filter) and
[`Bitset`](#bitset), and the [`IteratorContext`](#iteratorcontext) used for incremental search. The
deprecated [`SearchParam`](#searchparam-deprecated) is documented at the end for migration.

## `SearchRequest`

Declared in `vsag/search_request.h`. `SearchRequest` is a plain struct that bundles every option for
[`Index::SearchWithRequest`](index_class.md#searchwithrequest). Fill in the fields you need and leave
the rest at their defaults.

```cpp
vsag::SearchRequest request;
request.query_ = query;      // DatasetPtr with one query vector
request.mode_ = vsag::SearchMode::KNN_SEARCH;
request.topk_ = 10;
request.params_str_ = R"({"hgraph": {"ef_search": 100}})";

auto result = index->SearchWithRequest(request);
```

### `SearchMode`

```cpp
enum class SearchMode {
    KNN_SEARCH = 1,    // return the top-k nearest vectors
    RANGE_SEARCH = 2,  // return all vectors within radius_
};
```

### Basic fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `query_` | `DatasetPtr` | `nullptr` | The query. IVF KNN requests support multiple query vectors; other requests allow one. |
| `mode_` | `SearchMode` | `KNN_SEARCH` | KNN vs. range search. |
| `topk_` | `int64_t` | `10` | Neighbors to return (KNN mode). Must be positive. |
| `radius_` | `float` | `0.5` | Distance threshold (range mode). Non-negative. |
| `limited_size_` | `int64_t` | `-1` | Cap on range results; `-1` means no limit. |
| `params_str_` | `std::string` | `""` | Algorithm-specific search params as JSON (e.g. `ef_search`). |

### Custom query distance callback

`distance_batch_func_` optionally supplies query-to-vector scores from application code. It receives
stable external vector IDs, so a closure can keep the query and query-specific state outside VSAG:

```cpp
request.distance_batch_size_ = 32;
request.distance_batch_func_ = [query](const int64_t* ids, uint64_t count, float* scores) {
    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        scores[i] = Score(query, ids[i]);
    }
};
```

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `distance_batch_func_` | `SearchDistanceBatchFunc` | `nullptr` | Fills one score for each input external ID, in input order. Smaller finite scores are better. |
| `distance_batch_size_` | `uint64_t` | `1` | Maximum IDs passed to one callback invocation. Set this to the scorer's efficient batch width for batched inference or external data access. Must be positive when a callback is set. |

The callback is request-scoped and is not serialized. It may capture the query. `hgraph` permits a
null `query_` in callback mode, while `ivf` still requires one query vector for bucket routing. The
callback must be stable for one request, thread-safe if the caller enables parallel execution,
non-throwing, and must write only finite scores.

`brute_force` uses the callback for exact KNN and range search. `hgraph` supports KNN only; the
callback drives graph traversal and final ordering, while the graph remains built with its configured
built-in metric. Therefore recall under the callback score is not guaranteed. HGraph may score
filtered traversal nodes to preserve graph connectivity, but filtered nodes are never returned.
Callback HGraph does not support parallel search or `brute_force_threshold`; those configurations
are rejected rather than silently changing search semantics.

`ivf` supports callback KNN with a non-null single query vector. IVF uses its configured built-in
metric to select `scan_buckets_count` buckets, then applies the callback to candidates in those
buckets. The callback controls candidate ranking but cannot recover vectors outside the selected
buckets; increase `scan_buckets_count` to improve recall. Callback IVF does not support range search,
`disable_bucket_scan`, bucket-graph search, or parallel search. Those configurations are rejected.
Reordering is automatically disabled in callback mode. Other indexes do not support the callback.

### IVF bucket routing

IVF accepts `{"ivf":{"scan_buckets_count":N,"disable_bucket_scan":true}}` through
`params_str_`. This routing-only mode returns the `N` selected bucket IDs per query in the
result `Dataset` instead of vector labels. `NumElements()` equals the number of queries,
`Dim()` equals `scan_buckets_count`, `GetIds()` contains bucket IDs (with `-1` for empty
slots), and `GetDistances()` has distances to bucket centroids. No vector scan is performed,
so filters, `topk`, range limits, reordering, and reasoning options are ignored.

### IVF bucket IDs bypass

The `bucket_ids_` field allows callers to provide pre-selected bucket IDs, bypassing IVF's
internal bucket routing (`ClassifyDatasForSearch`). When non-empty, the search skips centroid-based
selection and scans only the specified buckets.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `bucket_ids_` | `std::vector<std::vector<int64_t>>` | `{}` | Pre-selected bucket IDs for bypassing IVF routing. |

**Semantics:**
- **Empty** (default): Use normal bucket routing via `ClassifyDatasForSearch`.
- **Non-empty**: Skip routing and scan only the provided bucket IDs.
- **Batch IVF KNN**: One outer `bucket_ids_` entry per query vector.
  Result is rectangular: `NumElements()` is query count, `Dim()` is `topk_`.
  Missing neighbors are `-1` with infinite distance.

**Constraints:**
- Batch IVF search supports KNN only; custom query distance and reasoning labels are unsupported.
- A non-empty outer vector must contain exactly one non-empty entry per query vector.
- Each bucket ID must be in range `[0, bucket_count)`.
- Duplicate bucket IDs are rejected.
- Incompatible with `disable_bucket_scan` mode.
- Caller is responsible for ordering bucket IDs (no automatic sorting).

### Filtering fields

Three filtering mechanisms are available and are combined with logical **AND** when more than one is
enabled.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `enable_attribute_filter_` | `bool` | `false` | Enable SQL-style attribute filtering. |
| `attribute_filter_str_` | `std::string` | `""` | The filter expression (see below). Requires `enable_attribute_filter_`. |
| `enable_filter_` | `bool` | `false` | Enable a custom [`Filter`](#filter) callback. |
| `filter_` | `FilterPtr` | `nullptr` | The filter object. Requires `enable_filter_`. |
| `enable_bitset_filter_` | `bool` | `false` | Enable a [`Bitset`](#bitset) filter. |
| `bitset_filter_` | `BitsetPtr` | `nullptr` | The bitset. `Test(id) == true` **excludes** id. Requires `enable_bitset_filter_`. |

The `attribute_filter_str_` grammar is SQL-like. Examples:

```text
category = 'electronics' AND price != 1000
multi_in(category, ['electronics', 'clothing']) AND multi_notin(color, ['red', 'blue'])
```

See [Attribute Filter (Hybrid Search)](../advanced/attribute_filter.md) and
[Filtered Search](../advanced/filtered_search.md).

### Resource & iterator fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `search_allocator_` | `Allocator*` | `nullptr` | Per-search allocator; falls back to the index allocator when null. |
| `enable_iterator_search_` | `bool` | `false` | Enable incremental (iterator) search. |
| `p_iter_ctx_` | `IteratorContext**` | `nullptr` | Handle to the iterator state, reused across calls. |
| `is_last_search_` | `bool` | `false` | Marks the final call of an iterator sequence. |
| `expected_labels_` | `std::vector<int64_t>` | `{}` | Ids expected in the result; enables reasoning analysis of missed recalls. |

See [Per-Search Allocator](../advanced/search_allocator.md) and
[Iterator Search](../advanced/iterator_search.md), plus `examples/cpp/313`/`314` for the allocator.

## `Filter`

Declared in `vsag/filter.h`. Implement this abstract class to express arbitrary "keep this id?"
logic. Hold it through `FilterPtr` (`std::shared_ptr<Filter>`).

```cpp
class Filter {
public:
    enum class Distribution { NONE = 0, RELATED_TO_VECTOR };

    virtual bool CheckValid(int64_t id) const = 0;          // true  => KEEP the id
    virtual bool CheckValid(const char* data) const;         // extra-info variant (default true)
    virtual float ValidRatio() const;                        // fraction kept (default 1.0)
    virtual Distribution FilterDistribution() const;         // hint (default NONE)
    virtual void GetValidIds(const int64_t** valid_ids, int64_t& count) const;
};
```

> **Convention:** `Filter::CheckValid(id)` returns `true` to **keep** a vector. This is the opposite
> of the `bitset` / `std::function<bool(int64_t)>` pre-filter overloads on
> [`Index`](index_class.md#knnsearch-overloads), where `true` means *filtered out*. Keep this
> distinction in mind when choosing an overload.

| Member | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `CheckValid(int64_t id)` | Core predicate. `true` keeps the id in results. |
| `CheckValid(const char* data)` | Predicate over an element's extra-info bytes. Defaults to `true`. |
| `ValidRatio()` | Estimated fraction of vectors that pass; lets the engine pick a strategy. |
| `FilterDistribution()` | `RELATED_TO_VECTOR` hints validity correlates with vector position. |
| `GetValidIds(...)` | Optionally expose the explicit valid-id set. |

See `examples/cpp/301_feature_filter.cpp`.

## `Bitset`

Declared in `vsag/bitset.h`. A compact set of bit flags keyed by position, held through `BitsetPtr`.
It is used both as a filtering input and as a utility (e.g. the result of
[`l2_and_filtering`](types.md#utility-functions)).

```cpp
static BitsetPtr Random(int64_t length);  // random bitset of the given length
static BitsetPtr Make();                  // empty bitset

void Set(int64_t pos, bool value);
void Set(int64_t pos);       // = Set(pos, true)
bool Test(int64_t pos) const;
uint64_t Count();            // number of set bits
std::string Dump();          // debug dump
```

> When a `Bitset` is used as a search pre-filter (`bitset_filter_`, or the `invalid` argument of
> `KnnSearch` / `RangeSearch`), `Test(id) == true` means the id is **filtered out**.

## `IteratorContext`

Declared in `vsag/iterator_context.h`. An opaque handle that stores the position of an in-progress
iterator search so that subsequent calls resume where the previous one stopped.

```cpp
class IteratorContext {
public:
    virtual ~IteratorContext() = default;
};
```

You do not construct or inspect it directly. VSAG allocates it on the first iterator search; pass the
same handle back (via `SearchRequest::p_iter_ctx_`, or the `KnnSearch` iterator overload) on each
subsequent call, and set the last-search flag on the final call so the engine can release it. See
[Iterator Search](../advanced/iterator_search.md).

## `SearchParam` (deprecated)

Declared in `vsag/search_param.h`. `SearchParam` predates `SearchRequest` and is retained only for
the deprecated `KnnSearch(query, k, SearchParam&)` overload.

```cpp
struct SearchParam {  // [[deprecated]] use SearchRequest
    bool is_iter_filter{false};
    bool is_last_search{false};
    const std::string& parameters;
    FilterPtr filter{nullptr};
    Allocator* allocator{nullptr};
    IteratorContext* iter_ctx{nullptr};
};
```

**Prefer [`SearchRequest`](#searchrequest) + [`SearchWithRequest`](index_class.md#searchwithrequest)
for all new code.** `SearchParam` holds `parameters` by reference, so the referenced string must
outlive the call.
