# RaBitQ x+y Split

RaBitQ x+y split is an HGraph and Pyramid storage and search mode for low-bit base codes.
Each vector is divided into two records:

- `x` filter bits are read during graph traversal and lower-bound filtering.
- `y` supplement bits are fetched only for candidates that reach reorder.
- The final reorder distance uses all `x+y` bits.

This layout keeps the traversal record small while retaining a higher-precision
RaBitQ distance for final ranking. It also allows the filter record to stay in
memory while the colder supplement record is stored on disk.

## Enable split mode

HGraph and Pyramid select split mode when both quantization types are `rabitq` and
`rabitq_bits_per_dim_precise` is present:

```json
{
    "dtype": "float32",
    "metric_type": "l2",
    "dim": 960,
    "index_param": {
        "base_quantization_type": "rabitq",
        "precise_quantization_type": "rabitq",
        "use_reorder": true,
        "rabitq_bits_per_dim_query": 32,
        "rabitq_bits_per_dim_base": 3,
        "rabitq_bits_per_dim_precise": 5,
        "rabitq_error_rate": 1.9,
        "max_degree": 64,
        "ef_construction": 400
    }
}
```

The relevant parameters are:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `base_quantization_type` | Must be `"rabitq"`. |
| `precise_quantization_type` | Must also be `"rabitq"` to select split mode. |
| `rabitq_bits_per_dim_base` | `x`, the number of filter bits read during traversal. |
| `rabitq_bits_per_dim_precise` | `y`, the number of supplement bits fetched during reorder. |
| `rabitq_bits_per_dim_query` | Must be `32` for split storage. |
| `rabitq_error_rate` | Default positive multiplier applied to the lower-bound error term. |
| `use_reorder` | Should be `true` so candidates are ranked with the `x+y` distance. |
| `rabitq_fused_datacell` | HGraph only; enables fused graph/code layout. Default: `false`. |
| `train_sample_count` | Maximum HGraph training sample size. The default is `65536`; the minimum explicit value is `512`. |

The constraints are:

```text
1 <= x <= 8
1 <= y <= 8
x + y <= 8
```

If `rabitq_bits_per_dim_precise` is omitted, HGraph and Pyramid use the standard RaBitQ
path instead of split storage.

### HGraph fused in-memory layout

For HGraph only, set `rabitq_fused_datacell` to `true` to store each
bottom-layer node's neighbors, cluster id, label, x-bit code, and y-bit
supplement in one cache-line-aligned record. Pyramid uses ordinary split
storage; `rabitq_fused_datacell` is not a Pyramid parameter. The specialized
HGraph search loop reads the record directly and prefetches graph links and
quantized codes together. The codec uses 16 reproducibly trained residual
clusters.

By default, fused HGraph trains the base RaBitQ quantizer and fused KMeans codec on at most 65,536
vectors. When `train_sample_count` is smaller than the dataset, it selects that many vectors using
fixed-seed uniform reservoir sampling. Increasing the value can improve cluster-centroid quality at
the cost of build time and temporary training memory; set it to at least the dataset size to train
on all vectors.

This option creates an incrementally mutable in-memory index. After `Build` or
Deserialize, it supports `Add`, mark remove, vector/id/attribute/extra-info
updates, search (including filters, iterators, range search, and concurrent
queries), distance-by-id, memory statistics, and serialization/deserialization.
Force remove, merge, tune, clone, model export, and build-cache import/export
remain unsupported. `Build` and Deserialize leave the index mutable and retain
the search and per-node locks. Call `SetImmutable` explicitly when no more
mutations are needed; this terminal transition removes those locks from the
search path, and later mutations are rejected.

Each record starts with a 4-byte neighbor count followed by plain
`InnerIdType` neighbor IDs. There is no node version and no version encoding in
neighbor IDs. Cluster id, aligned external label, filter code, and supplement
follow; the record stride remains rounded up to a 64-byte boundary. Storage can
grow during `Build` and later `Add` operations.

The optimized build uses temporary SQ8 scalar codes for symmetric base-to-base
graph construction, then discards them. The completed index keeps only the
fused RaBitQ records. Post-build `Add` decodes fused records on demand for
pairwise graph updates, so it does not retain an SQ8 or raw-vector copy; batch
adds are preferable when insertion throughput matters.

The fused layout is opt-in and has stricter constraints than ordinary split
storage:

- `1 <= x <= 4`, `y >= 1`, and `x + y <= 8`.
- The metric must be L2 or inner product.
- The graph, filter codes, and supplement codes must all use memory IO.
- MCI, `deduplicate_storage`, removal metadata, reverse edges, and force remove
  must be disabled.
- PCA is not supported; omit `rabitq_pca_dim` or set it to `0`.
- The legacy v0.14 serialization format is not supported.
- The fused slab wire format is versioned independently. The current format
  intentionally rejects earlier development formats that contained node
  versions and remove flags.

Indexes created without this option keep their existing layout, behavior, and
serialization format.

Enable the filter/lower-bound search path with:

```json
{
    "hgraph": {
        "ef_search": 200,
        "parallelism": 4,
        "rabitq_one_bit_search": true,
        "rabitq_error_rate": 1.9
    }
}
```

For Pyramid, put the equivalent search controls under `pyramid`:

```json
{
    "pyramid": {
        "ef_search": 200,
        "rabitq_one_bit_search": true,
        "rabitq_error_rate": 1.9
    }
}
```

The external search key is named `rabitq_one_bit_search`, but on a split index
it uses all `x` filter bits configured by `rabitq_bits_per_dim_base`.
`hgraph.rabitq_error_rate` and `pyramid.rabitq_error_rate` override the index
default for their respective searches without requiring a rebuild. Native
fused HGraph records store the geometric error scale before this multiplier is
applied. HNSW-compatible fused `1+7` records retain metadata scaled by the
canonical default and apply an override as a ratio at query time.

## Search pipeline

The split search path has four stages:

1. The query is transformed and normalized once. For supported filter widths,
   a byte lookup table is also built once per query.
2. Graph traversal reads only the filter record. It computes an x-bit distance
   estimate and a conservative lower bound for each visited vector.
3. Reorder discards candidates whose lower bound cannot enter the result set.
   It fetches the y-bit supplement record only for the remaining candidates.
4. The final distance combines the filter contribution and supplement
   contribution into one `x+y`-bit RaBitQ estimate.

The graph-search heap is therefore not populated with an `x+y` distance for every
visited vector. The inexpensive x-bit distance drives traversal; the more
accurate distance is evaluated only during candidate reorder.

## Encoding and bit planes

Let:

```text
d       = transformed dimension
x       = filter bits per dimension
y       = supplement bits per dimension
B       = x + y
P       = ceil(d / 8), bytes in one bit plane
q_i     = transformed and normalized query coordinate
u_i     = unsigned B-bit base code, 0 <= u_i < 2^B
```

The centered full code is:

```text
c_B = (2^B - 1) / 2
z_i = u_i - c_B
N_B = sqrt(sum_i z_i^2)
```

`PackIntoPlanes` stores each logical bit of `u_i` in a separate bit plane.
The split is defined by:

```text
f_i = floor(u_i / 2^y)    # top x bits
s_i = u_i mod 2^y         # low y bits
u_i = 2^y * f_i + s_i
```

The physical order keeps the most significant filter planes contiguous:

```text
filter record:     logical B-1, B-2, ..., B-x
supplement record: logical 0, 1, ..., y-1
```

This order lets traversal scan exactly `x * P` plane bytes and lets reorder
fetch exactly `y * P` additional plane bytes, excluding metadata and alignment.

## Datacell layout

`RaBitQSplitDataCell` owns two `RaBitQSplitCodeStorage` instances.

### Filter record

The filter record in `x_bit_cell_` contains:

```text
x high bit planes
base norm
filter-code norm when x > 1
optional MRQ residual norm
optional raw norm for IP/cosine
lower-bound error
filter approximation error
```

For one vector, its plane payload is:

```text
FilterPlanesSize = x * ceil(d / 8)
```

The filter record is the hot traversal record. Graph search and prefetch do
not need the supplement record while the x-bit estimate is valid.

### Supplement record

The supplement record in `supplement_cell_` contains:

```text
y low bit planes
full-code norm
full-code approximation error
remaining metadata required by the selected metric and transforms
```

Its plane payload is:

```text
SupplementPlanesSize = y * ceil(d / 8)
```

The complete code payload is approximately `(x+y) * d / 8` bytes per vector,
plus aligned norms, errors, and optional transform metadata.

## X-bit filter estimate and lower bound

The filter code for coordinate `i` is `f_i` in `[0, 2^x - 1]`. Define:

```text
c_x   = (2^x - 1) / 2
N_x   = sqrt(sum_i (f_i - c_x)^2)
S_x   = sum_i q_i * f_i
Q_sum = sum_i q_i
rho_x = (S_x - c_x * Q_sum) / N_x
```

During index construction, RaBitQ stores the absolute filter approximation
error `E_x` and the geometric error scale:

```text
E_safe    = clamp(abs(E_x), 1e-5, 1)
epsilon_x = sqrt(max(0, 1 - E_safe^2) / max(1, d - 1))
```

The corrected filter inner-product estimate is:

```text
rho_hat_x = rho_x / abs(E_x)
```

For L2, with base norm `N_o` and query norm `N_q`, the x-bit distance and
lower bound are:

```text
D_x = N_o^2 + N_q^2 - 2 * N_o * N_q * rho_hat_x

LB = D_x
     - 2 * N_o * N_q * rabitq_error_rate * epsilon_x / abs(E_x)
```

The implementation subtracts a small floating-point guard from `LB`. IP and
cosine apply the corresponding metric conversion to the error term.

The lower bound is used only to reject candidates safely. `D_x` remains the
traversal estimate, while the final ranking uses the `x+y` distance.

## Query lookup table and SIMD

For `x = 2` and `x = 3`, the query computer builds a FastScan-style byte
lookup table. Each table row corresponds to eight query coordinates and has
256 entries:

```text
LUT[block][byte_value]
    = sum of q_i for the set bits in byte_value within that 8-D block
```

Each filter plane then contributes one lookup per byte instead of decoding
eight coordinates separately. Binary weights combine the x planes into
`S_x`.

The AVX2 and AVX512 kernels gather multiple lookup entries at once and also
provide a batch-of-four path. The scalar implementation is kept as the
portable fallback. The relevant entry points are:

- `RaBitQFloatMultiBitIPByLookup`
- `RaBitQFloatMultiBitIPBatch4ByLookup`
- `RaBitQFloatBuildByteIPLookupTable`

An x-bit width outside the specialized set remains supported through the
generic bit-plane computation path.

## Reorder scans only y supplement bits

The full unsigned code satisfies:

```text
sum_i q_i * u_i
    = 2^y * sum_i q_i * f_i
      + sum_i q_i * s_i
```

For `x >= 2`, the dedicated fused HGraph search/reorder path carries the exact
x-bit filter inner product from traversal to reorder. It consumes the hint
while reading codes directly from the node record, so full rerank computes only
the second term from the y supplement planes:

```text
full contribution = shifted filter contribution + supplement contribution
```

Thus fused `2+y`, `3+y`, and `4+y` indexes reuse the exact x-bit filter inner
product and scan only the y supplement planes for each reranked candidate. The
richer filter-IP/full-distance candidate record is private to HGraph's fused
search path; generic HGraph searchers, Pyramid, and `ReorderInterface` retain
the original distance/id candidate protocol. The fused `1+y` traversal uses a four-bit query bit-plane and
popcount approximation; precise reranking recomputes its exact one-bit
contribution because the approximate value is not an exact full-distance
hint. If a usable hint is unavailable, the code computes the same final
distance directly from both split records.

## Memory, disk, and hybrid IO

Both records use the base IO type unless a separate supplement IO type is
configured.

### Both records in memory

```json
{
    "base_io_type": "block_memory_io"
}
```

### Both records on disk

```json
{
    "base_io_type": "async_io",
    "base_file_path": "/data/hgraph_rabitq_split"
}
```

VSAG creates separate backing paths for the filter and supplement records.

### Filter in memory, supplement on disk

```json
{
    "base_io_type": "block_memory_io",
    "base_supplement_io_type": "async_io",
    "base_file_path": "/data/hgraph_rabitq_split"
}
```

The supported mixed-IO combination keeps `x_bit_cell_` in block memory and
places `supplement_cell_` in async IO. During batched reorder, the filter
record is read by direct pointer while `MultiRead` fetches only supplement
records. `base_supplement_file_path` may be set explicitly; otherwise VSAG
derives a supplement path from `base_file_path`.

## Serialization and loading

Use the normal index-level serialization API. Applications do not need to
persist the two records independently.

```cpp
std::ofstream out("/path/to/index.bin", std::ios::binary);
auto serialized = index->Serialize(out);

auto loaded = vsag::Factory::CreateIndex("hgraph", index_params).value();
std::ifstream in("/path/to/index.bin", std::ios::binary);
auto deserialized = loaded->Deserialize(in);
```

The split datacell serializes, in order:

1. Base datacell state and supplement IO type.
2. Filter storage.
3. Supplement storage.
4. RaBitQ quantizer state.

Create the destination index with parameters compatible with the serialized
index, especially `dim`, `metric_type`, x/y bit widths, and query bits.
Changing an encoded parameter requires rebuilding the index. Tuning only the
search-time `hgraph.rabitq_error_rate` or `pyramid.rabitq_error_rate` does not.

For a fused index, the codec model is serialized with the split datacell and
the per-node codes are serialized once as part of the bottom-graph slab.
Ordinary and streaming round trips preserve this layout without creating a
second count-scaled copy of the split codes.

## Operational notes

- Split storage is currently available on HGraph and Pyramid and requires fp32
  query codes. Pyramid enables the one-bit split search path by default for
  split indexes; pass `rabitq_one_bit_search: false` under `pyramid` to force
  the standard search path.
- `l2`, `ip`, and `cosine` are supported. For `x >= 2`, the canonical ordinary
  split and fused HGraph paths directly reuse the exact filter inner product
  for L2 and inner product. Other cases safely compute the full split distance.
- The fused datacell supports only L2 and inner product and only the in-memory
  configuration described above.
- Fused HGraph remains mutable after `Build` and deserialize. It supports
  post-build `Add`, mark remove, and vector/id/attribute/extra-info updates, but
  not force remove. Call `SetImmutable` explicitly for the lock-free read-only
  search path.
- With `support_duplicate: true`, duplicate build probes and alias-expanding
  queries use the canonical HGraph searcher; the fused slab remains the code
  and graph storage.
- Keep `use_reorder: true` unless x-bit traversal accuracy alone has been
  validated for the dataset.
- Changing x, y, metric, or transform parameters requires rebuilding the
  index. A search-time `hgraph.rabitq_error_rate` or
  `pyramid.rabitq_error_rate` override does not.
- Use [RaBitQ](rabitq.md) for the general quantizer description and
  [HGraph](../indexes/hgraph.md) and [Pyramid](../indexes/pyramid.md) for the
  complete index parameter tables.
